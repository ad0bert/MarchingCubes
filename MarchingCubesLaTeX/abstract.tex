Considering the computer based image processing there are multiple possibilities to represent three-dimensional objects. The most common way to illustrate these objects is the polygonal approach. This approach fragments an object into triangles.
\\\\
An other possible procedure to model objects is to represent them as a voxel grid. But if we consider the ability to process this kind of representation we have to face some disadvantages. The main problems are: the model needs a comparatively high amount of disk space, it takes much longer to show the image and it is difficult to perform manipulations on the object.
\\\\
In the field of Medical imaging such as computed tomography creates such voxel models, these should be presented quickly and meaningfully.
\\\\
Considering the set of problems above, this thesis presents the ''Marching Cubes Algorighm''. This Algorithm enables us to transform voxel objects into a polygonal form. 
\\\\\
This thesis gives an insight of the basic terms and provides an implementation of the Marching Cubes Algorithm.
\\\\
On the base of the simple but efficient implementation it is easy to follow the functionality of the algorithm. The basic form shows the big potential of the algorithm for enhancements. Because of the fact that many of this possible enhancements are already developed, the wide spread of this algorithm is not surprising at all.
